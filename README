features:

0. what it does:
	- succesffuly detect noclip/fly. Its just a matter of time when someone noclipping/flying is detected.
	- players cant know when they are being watch since intervals are randomized
	- lag resistant (see CHECK_AGAIN in settings)

1. moderators can:
	-see full reports with coordinates of location as cheats occur
	-use /cstats to see latest detected cheater
	-use /cdebug to see even suspected cheats to be verified later
	-use /watch NAME to spectate suspect/detected cheater, /unwatch to return to normal

managing moderators:
	-edit names inside anticheatsettings.moderators in settings.lua
	-Any player with kick privileges is moderator and is additionaly ignored by cheat checks. Use this for admin only - cheaters can then see who moderators are.
	
2. this mod works well with basic_vote mod. After cheater has been positively detected anyone can use /vote to kick, remove interact or kill cheater. Vote in this case is cast anonymously, under the name #anticheat.
